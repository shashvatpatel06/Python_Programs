## 03_Strings
1)	Count how many vowels are there in a string. Accept the string from the user.
2)	Write your own functions (without using built-in functions) to convert all characters of a string into lower case/upper case/toggle case.
3)	Accept two strings. Check whether one string is there in another string.
4)	Write a function that removes one string from another string, if present. E.g. Onestring = “abcdef”, removestring = “cd”. The finalstring should contain “abef”.
